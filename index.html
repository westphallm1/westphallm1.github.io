                    Hi I'm Matthew. I'm a CS undergraduate at UW Madison and
                    over the summer I got <span class="nav-link">REALLY</span>
                    into David Bowie, so I decided to dedicate my UW-webpage
                    as a fan site.  When I rock and code with him, no one
                    else I'd rather be. Anyways, this is my personal website,
                    and is currently my playground for learning a bit of
                    front-end. Powered by Bootstrap. All music is by David
                    Bowie, of course. None of the videos are mine, and are
                    liable to be taken down at any time. Hope you enjoy!

                            I said I knew what this song is about, but man is it
                            catchy! This track comes off of Station to Station,
                            released in 1976, the same year as the film the Man
                            Who Fell to Earth. Bowie stars in this movie as an 
                            alien who comes to earth looking to bring water back
                            to his dying home planet, but ultimately succumbs to
                            the earthly vices of television and alcohol. Perhaps
                            the song's lyrics tie into the plot: "Oh so demonic 
                            oh my <span class="nav-link">T V C ONE FIVE!</span>"

                                This track comes off of Low, Bowie's first album
                                following his relocation to Berlin. With a driving
                                beat, minimal lyrics, and that irresistable 3 note
                                synth thing at the end of every verse, this song
                                paints an etherial image of what I can only guess
                                is a breakup gone horribly wrong. While the album's
                                whole B-side is devoted to avante-garde instrumental
                                tracks, this one and the others on the A-side are a bit
                                more accessible for a casual listener such as myself.
                                "You're such a wonderful person! But you've got 
                                problems! Oooooooh!"

                            As the embedded youtube video so helpfully explains,
                            this song's title means "Long Live" in Turkish.
                            Featuring a world-beat sound and the excellent
                            sing-along line: "YAAASSAAASSINN!!" at the end of every
                            phrase, this track is sure to be crowd pleaser. 
                            This track comes from Lodger, Bowie's third and
                            final Berlin release. Other great tracks from there
                            include "African Night Flight", another great world
                            beat selection; and "Red Sail", a song which 
                            talks a great deal about hinterlands.

                                This song, off the the 1974 album Diamond Dogs, carries
                                the heartfelt joys of rock and roll music. It's the only
                                song on this list to have been paraphrased in the "About"
                                section, which is no small feat. It comes from the 1974
                                album Diamond Dogs, which came hot off the heels of the
                                death of Ziggy Stardust and the birth of a new character,
                                Halloween Jack. Originally intended to tell the story of
                                George Orwell's "1984," the content of the album had to
                                be altered after Orwell's estate denied Bowie's
                                requests for the novel.

                            This track comes off of Bowie's 1980 album Scary
                            Monsters (and Super Creeps), and tells the story
                            of the narrator and his friend Sam, two political
                            dissidents who are jailed and tortured by a 
                            totalitarian government. Although it came out 6 
                            years after Diamond Dogs, I get a very "1984" feel
                            from it. The song has music to fit its grim lyrics,
                            with a determined, driving beat and pained vocals. 
                            Other great songs off this album include the title
                            track, "It's no Game (Part 1)," and "Teenage Wildlife."

                    done much with them independently.
